#  Read-only Root-FS for most linux distributions using overlayfs
#  Version 1.5
#
#  Version History:
#  1.0: initial release
#  1.1: adopted new fstab style with PARTUUID. the script will now look for a /dev/xyz definiton first
#       (old raspbian), if that is not found, it will look for a partition with LABEL=rootfs, if that
#       is not found it look for a PARTUUID string in fstab for / and convert that to a device name
#       using the blkid command.
#  1.2: clean useless lines in fstab before read it. do not mount /proc if already mounted. some fixes to
#       fit other distributions. reformat the script to a more simple style.
#  1.3: add support for UUID in fstab. deprecated PARTUUID support because it's not safe to handle every
#       circumstances. rename /ro to /lower and /rw to /overlay. fix permission issue on /overlay. fix
#       "already mounted on /" issue on some distributions(caused by mawk). add log interface and increase
#       log verbosity.
#  1.4: fix "ERROR: could not umount old root" when "\0" is not properly escaped.
#  1.5: Add default $PATH, some command in /usr/sbin directory
#
#  Created 2017 by Pascal Suter @ DALCO AG, Switzerland to work on Raspian as custom init script
#  (raspbian does not use an initramfs on boot)

#  Tested with Raspbian mini, 2018-10-09
#
#  This script will mount the root filesystem read-only and overlay it with a temporary tempfs
#  which is read-write mounted. This is done using the overlayFS which is part of the linux kernel
#  since version 3.18.
#  when this script is in use, all changes made to anywhere in the root filesystem mount will be lost
#  upon reboot of the system. The SD card will only be accessed as read-only drive, which significantly
#  helps to prolong its life and prevent filesystem coruption in environments where the system is usually
#  not shut down properly
#
#  Install:
#  copy this script to /sbin/overlayRoot.sh, make it executable and add "init=/sbin/overlayRoot.sh" to the
#  cmdline.txt file in the raspbian image's boot partition.
#  I strongly recommend to disable swapping before using this. it will work with swap but that just does
#  not make sens as the swap file will be stored in the tempfs which again resides in the ram.
#  run these commands on the booted raspberry pi BEFORE you set the init=/sbin/overlayRoot.sh boot option:
#  sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff
#  sudo dphys-swapfile uninstall
#  sudo update-rc.d dphys-swapfile remove
#
#  To install software, run upgrades and do other changes to the raspberry setup, simply remove the init=
#  entry from the cmdline.txt file and reboot, make the changes, add the init= entry and reboot once more.
